                            <p>Split-It is an Android app that will allow users to easily split costs with their friends, roommates, business partners, etc.  Our app will simplify the task of determining who owes who what by keeping track of it for you; all you need is your receipts and our app will do the work for you!</p>

                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <p>The ultimate goal of this project is to meet all the requirements mentioned in this document, and have an app that is not only functioning properly, but that brings true value to the users.  Furthermore, we hope that each feature we implement is done so in the most efficient, and user friendly way possible.</p>
                <p>Specifically our goals for this project are being able to successfully extract text from receipts using OCR, being able to perform appropriate actions given the data read from the receipt, performing accurate calculations regardless of the number of items or users in a group, implement profiles and successfully sync the data with the server, give the user the ability to edit their profile, and finally implement a clean, user friendly UI.  In addition to these goals, we have a few stretch goals that we hope we have time to implement.  These goals include implementing Venmo payments within the app, and possibly even implementing automatic payments at the end of the month to settle costs.  Our last stretch goal is to have a highly optimized app.  OCR is an intensive process, and we hope that we can optimize this as well as any server communications, so that there is little noticeable delay for the user.</p>
